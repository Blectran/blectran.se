            <p>Today I made this website. Hopefully I will continue improving it and actually use it as I intend.</p>
            <p>I am currently making a game as a project in school. It would be fun to share that here when it is done.</p>
            <p>It's also getting darker outside, whick makes it possible to see stars which I think is very fun.</p>
            <p>Space is cool and last year I was very intrigued with astrophotography. I might try to photograph som cool stuff this year too! :3</p>
            <p>Also, I want to program more things. I wanna learn to program in Rust.</p>
